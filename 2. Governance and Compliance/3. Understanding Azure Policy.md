# Understanding Azure Policy

- Enforce compliance and enable auditing.
- Organizations need to implement enterprise-level governance and compliance capability.
- Prohibit resources:
	- Control cost
	- Restrict service access
- Allowed location:
	- Geographical compliance

#### Components of a Policy

1. **Azure Policy**
	- Defines the evaluation criteria for compliance, and defines the actions that take place.
	- The scope at which we will assign our policy. The scope could be a management group, subscription, resource group, or resources.
	- A collection of policies that are tailored ti achieving a singular high-level goal together.

1. **Require Tag:**
	- Evaluate if a VM is being created with our tag. If the VM is missing tag then deny creation of the resources.
	- Assign the policy at the scope of the resource group where the VMs will be created.
