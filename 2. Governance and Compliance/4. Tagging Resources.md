# Tagging Resources

- **_name: value_** pairs used to organize resources.
- **tags** can consist of:
	- Name can be 512 chars and value can be 256 chars
	- Storage accounts can only have a name with 128 chars
- _example:_ shutdown all VMs with specific tags.

#### Resource Tag Assignment Hierarchy

- **Resource tags are not inherited from higher scope like resource groups.**
- Whenever we assign tags to resources, the individual resources underneath are not going to inherit by default.
- The resource group and the individual resources must be tagged independently.
- A resource can have 50 tags.
