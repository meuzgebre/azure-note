## Usage

The content in this repository is organized in Markdown files, which can be accessed directly from my GithHub or used offline with **Obsidian**, which is a note-taking tool. Using **Obsidian** locally provides an enhanced experience for viewing, editing, and organizing the notes into your personal knowledge base.

### Option 1: Accessing Notes Directly on GitHub

1. You can browse and view the notes directly on my GitHub in the repository. Each section (e.g., AZ-900, Azure Administration, etc.) has its own Markdown file that you can open and read.
   - For example, you can view **AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals)** notes [here](./AZ-900).
   - Similarly, notes for **Azure Storage**, **Virtual Networking**, and other topics can be accessed through their respective folders.

2. You can copy and paste content, or download specific files directly from GitHub if you need them locally.
   - However, when downloading a single markdown some links such as images or reference links might be broken. It's best to download the whole repositiory instead.
