# Creating Custom Roles

- Custom roles in Azure are tailored to meet specific needs when built-in roles do not suffice. 
- They offer flexibility in defining permissions and scopes, allowing you to create roles that align closely with your organizational requirements.

#### Why Use Custom Roles?

- **Granular Permissions:** When built-in roles provide too broad or too narrow access.
- **Compliance Needs:** To meet specific compliance or security requirements.
- **Specialized Tasks:** To grant permissions specific to certain tasks or workflows.

#### Role Definition Components

When creating a custom role, you define a JSON role definition. Key components include:

- **`Actions`:** Specifies the allowed actions. Use `"*"` to allow all actions.
- **`NotActions`:** Lists actions that are explicitly denied.
- **`DataActions`:** Specifies allowed actions on data, such as reading or writing specific data.
- **`NotDataActions`:** Lists data actions that are explicitly denied.
- **`AssignableScopes`:** Defines where the role can be assigned (e.g., subscription, resource group, or specific resource).

```
{
  "Name": "CustomContributor",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Allows managing resources but excludes delete actions and specific auth actions.",
  "Actions": [
    "*"
  ],
  "NotActions": [
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/delete",
    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write",
    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete"
  ],
  "DataActions": [],
  "NotDataActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}"
  ]
}
```

- **`Name`:** The name of the custom role.
- **`IsCustom`:** Indicates that the role is custom.
- **`Description`:** A brief description of the role and its purpose.
- **`Actions`:** Grants permission for all actions.
- **`NotActions`:** Denies the ability to delete virtual machines and manage authorization settings.
- **`DataActions`:** No specific data actions are defined.
- **`NotDataActions`:** No data actions are explicitly denied.
- **`AssignableScopes`:** Specifies that this role can be assigned at the subscription level or within a specific resource group.

#### Creating and Assigning Custom Roles

1. **Create the Role Definition:**
    
    - Use Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to create the role.
    - _example_, using Azure CLI:
	    - `az role definition create --role-definition @role-definition.json
`

1. **Assign the Role:**
    
    - Assign the custom role to users, groups, or service principals as needed.
    - _example_, using Azure CLI:
	    - `az role assignment create --assignee <principalId> --role "CustomContributor" --scope "/subscriptions/{subscript`

> **Roles** are a collection of permissions.
