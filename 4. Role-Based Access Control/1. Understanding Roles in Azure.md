# Understanding Roles in Azure

- **Security Principles:** Who we going to provide access to?
- **Roles:** What that user will be able to do?
- **Scope:** where they can perform these actions?

#### Azure Roles (Azure RBAC)

- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to manage access to Azure resources.
- **Scope:** Roles can be applied at various levels, including management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and individual resources.
- Custom roles can also be defined to tailor permissions to specific needs.

- **Built-in Roles:**
    - **Owner:** Full access to all resources and the ability to delegate access.
    - **Reader:** Can only view resources, without making changes.
    - **Contributor:** Can create and manage resources, but cannot delegate access.
    - **User Access Administrator:** Can manage access permissions and delegate access to others.

#### Azure Active Directory (AD) Roles

- Azure Active Directory (AD) roles manage access to Azure AD resources.
- **Scope:** These roles apply at the tenant level.

- **Built-in Roles:**
    - **Global Administrator:** Has full access to all aspects of Azure AD and can manage all aspects of the directory.
    - **Billing Administrator:** Manages billing tasks and subscriptions.
    - **User Administrator:** Manages user accounts and groups, including creating, editing, and deleting them.
    - **Helpdesk Administrator:** Can reset passwords and assist with user account issues.
