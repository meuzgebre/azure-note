# Assigning Access to Resources

#### Authorization System

Azure's authorization system follows a hierarchical model for access control:

1. **Implicit Deny:** By default, no access is granted to resources unless explicitly allowed.
2. **Explicit Allow:** Access is granted through explicit permissions assigned to roles.
3. **Explicit Deny:** Specific permissions can be explicitly denied, overriding any allowed permissions.

#### Role Definition Example

A role definition in Azure describes the permissions assigned to a role. For example, a Contributor role might be defined as follows:

```
{
  "Actions": ["*"],  // Full access to all actions
  "NotActions": [
    "Auth/*/Delete"  // Excludes delete actions on authentication resources
  ],
  "DataActions": [],  // No specific data actions
  "NotDataActions": [],  // No exclusions on data actions
  "AssignableScopes": ["/"]  // Role can be assigned at the root level
}

```

In this example:

- **Actions:** Specifies all actions allowed by the role.
- **NotActions:** Lists actions that are explicitly denied.
- **DataActions:** Specifies actions on data (e.g., reading or writing data).
- **NotDataActions:** Lists actions on data that are explicitly denied.
- **AssignableScopes:** Defines where the role can be assigned, such as a subscription or resource group.

#### Overlapping Roles

When a user is assigned multiple roles:

- **Additive Property:** The permissions of each role are combined. This means that if a user has multiple roles, they accumulate all permissions granted by these roles. For instance, if one role allows reading resources and another role allows modifying them, the user can both read and modify resources.

**Note:** Conflicts between roles are resolved based on the explicit deny principle. If one role denies a permission while another allows it, the deny takes precedence.
