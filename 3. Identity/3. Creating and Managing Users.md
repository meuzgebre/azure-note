# Creating and Managing Users

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), users are categorized into three primary types:

1. **Administrators**:
    
    - **User Admin**: Manages user accounts and groups, resets passwords, and can assign roles to other users.
    - **Global Admin**: Has the highest level of access and control, able to manage all aspects of the Azure AD and services, including other administrator roles and settings.
    
2. **Members**:
    
    - Standard users within the Azure AD tenant. They typically have access to resources and services based on their assigned roles and permissions but do not have administrative privileges.
    
3. **Guests**:
    
    - External users invited to access specific resources within the Azure AD tenant. They often have limited permissions and are granted access to only the resources shared with them.

**Users** can have:

- Default permissions and properties. These identities are JSON objects.
- Role assignment.
- Object ownership.
