# Creating Administrative Units

- Azure Administrative Units (AUs) are a feature within Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) designed to help organizations manage and delegate administrative responsibilities within a large tenant.
- Provide a way to delegate administrative tasks and organize users, groups, and devices within specific segments of your Azure AD tenant. This is useful for managing large and complex environments where different departments or regions need separate administrative controls.

**Use Cases**:
	- Assigning administrative roles and permissions within specific geographic regions or departments.
	- Delegating administrative responsibilities to local IT teams without granting them global permissions.
	- Managing users and resources according to organizational structure.
