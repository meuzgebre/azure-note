# Conceptualizing Azure Active Directory

### IAM Basics

- **Principal**: is an unauthenticated entity that will seek to authenticate as an identity.

### Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

- Global Services.
- Our instance of Azure AD service that represent our organization and acts us our identity repository
- Global cloud-based identity service for Azure that provides an identity repository.
- Create Identity Resource. 
	- Create users and groups.
- Management Identity Security. 
	- Enable MFA, control resource access, and provide policy-based control.

### Azure AD Tenant Architecture

- Tenant = Organizational = Directory  
- **Tenant**: The primary entity in Azure AD, representing a dedicated instance of the directory service for an organization. Each tenant is unique and isolated from others, with its own domain and user data.
- Because it represent our organization we going to need a domain. _e.g.,_ acg.onmicrosoft.com
