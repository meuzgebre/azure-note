# Creating and Managing Groups

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), groups are used to manage and organize users, assign roles, and control access to resources. There are three primary types of groups:

1. **Security Groups**:
    
    - Used to grant access to resources and manage permissions. 
    - Security groups can be assigned to applications, resources, and services, enabling bulk management of user permissions.
    - Assigning access to shared resources, configuring security policies, and managing permissions across applications.

2. **Microsoft 365 Groups**:
    
    - Designed to facilitate collaboration by providing shared resources such as mailboxes, calendars, files, and SharePoint sites. 
    - These groups integrate with Microsoft 365 applications and services.
    - Team collaboration, shared email, and document libraries, along with integration into Microsoft Teams and other Office 365 apps.
