# Implementing Virtual WAN

Azure Virtual WAN simplifies the process of building, managing, and optimizing the connectivity of your resources globally. It integrates several components, including Virtual Hubs, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.

### Steps for Implementation

1. **Create a Virtual WAN**:
    - Go to the Azure portal.
    - Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Virtual WAN".
    - Specify the name, resource group, and region.

2. **Create a Virtual Hub**:
    - Within your Virtual WAN, create a Virtual Hub.
    - This hub acts as a central point for your network traffic.
    - Specify the hub name, region, and address space.

3. **Configure Hub Connectivity**:
    - Add VPN gateways or ExpressRoute connections as needed.
    - Configure the desired routing options and connection types (Site-to-Site or Point-to-Site for VPN, or ExpressRoute for private connectivity).

4. **Connect Virtual Networks**:
    - Link your existing Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) to the Virtual Hub.
    - Ensure to configure the necessary routing for proper communication.

5. **Setup User VPN (Optional)**:
    - If you need remote access, configure the Point-to-Site VPN for users.
    - Define the authentication type and configure the necessary client settings.

6. **Configure Site-to-Site VPN Connections**:
    - Set up Site-to-Site VPN connections between your on-premises locations and the Virtual Hub.
    - Provide the public IP address of your on-premises VPN device and configure the necessary shared keys.

7. **Implement Routing**:
    - Define the routing policies based on your network design.
    - Use the Azure portal or PowerShell to manage route tables as needed.

8. **Monitor and Optimize**:
    - Use Azure Monitor and Network Watcher to keep track of the performance and health of your Virtual WAN setup.
    - Adjust configurations as necessary based on performance metrics and usage patterns.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that proper security measures are in place, including Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall, if necessary.
- **Scalability**: Plan for growth by considering additional hubs or connections as your network expands.
- **Cost Management**: Be aware of the pricing structure for Virtual WAN, including data transfer and connection costs.
