# Configuring Azure VNet Peering

#### Overview

- **Default Connectivity**: By default, Azure virtual networks (VNets) are isolated. While they allow intra-network traffic and outbound internet access, direct communication between VNets is not permitted.

#### VNet Peering

- **Purpose**: VNet Peering connects two or more VNets, enabling seamless communication between them.
- **Non-Reciprocal**: Connections must be established in both directions for full connectivity.
- **Non-Transitive**: VNet Peering does not allow indirect communication through another VNet.

#### Benefits

- **Low Latency, High Bandwidth**: Peered VNets enjoy low-latency and high-bandwidth connections.
- **Cross-Network Communication**: Enables applications across different VNets to communicate directly.
- **Data Transfer Capabilities**:
    - Across different **subscriptions**.
    - Between **Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenants** via Azure roles.
    - Across different **Azure regions**.
