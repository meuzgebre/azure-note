# Implementing VPNs

#### Overview

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) establish secure connectivity between VNets, similar to VNet Peering but with added encryption and flexibility.

#### Key Components

- **VNet Gateway**: A specific type of gateway used to manage VPN connections.
- **Gateway Subnet**: A dedicated subnet within the VNet for the VPN gateway.
- **Public IP**: Each VNet gateway requires a public IP address for external connectivity.
- **IPsec Tunnel**: Ensures data encryption during transit.

#### Route Types

1. **Policy-Based Routing**:
    
    - Utilizes static routing defined by policies.
    - Primarily used with legacy on-premise VPN devices.
    - Supports only IKEv1.
    - Limited to Basic SKU.

2. **Route-Based Routing**:
    
    - Supports both static and dynamic routing.
    - Resilient to changes in network topology.
    - Can coexist with Azure ExpressRoute.
    - Supports IKEv2 for enhanced security.

#### VPN Gateway SKUs

- **Basic VPN Gateway**: Suitable for development/testing environments only.

#### Active-Active vs Active-Passive

- **Active-Active**: Both gateways are operational, providing load balancing and failover capabilities.
- **Active-Passive**: One gateway is active while the other remains on standby, taking over only if the active gateway fails.
