# Configuring Azure File Sync

#### Overview

Azure File Sync extends on-premise file servers by:

- **Locally Caching**: Frequently accessed files on-premise.
- **Integration**: Supports SMB, NFS, and FTPS protocols.
- **Requirements**: Windows Server 2012 R2 or later and File Sync agent.

#### Components

1. **Storage Sync Service**:
    - High-level Azure resource that orchestrates the synchronization process.

2. **Cloud Endpoint**:   
    - Represents the Azure file share utilized in File Sync.

3. **Registered Server**:
    - On-premise file servers that are trusted and configured to sync with the cloud.

#### File Sync Cloud Tiering

- **Cloud Tiering**:
    - Keeps frequently accessed files locally for fast access.
    - Less frequently accessed files are stored in the cloud but appear as if they are on-premise.
    - Reduces local storage requirements by leveraging cloud storage.
