# Using Azure Jobs

Azure Jobs are a robust solution for transferring large volumes of data between on-premises environments and Azure Storage. They can handle different types of data and storage services effectively.

#### Data Transfer Options

1. **Blob Service**: Transfer data to or from Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Files Service**: Move data to or from Azure File Storage.
3. **Self-Supplied Drive**: Utilize your own drives for transport to Azure.

#### Supported Drive Types

- **SATA**: Standard drives for general use.
- **HDD**: Hard Disk Drives, suitable for bulk data storage.
- **SSD**: Solid State Drives, offering higher performance and faster data transfer rates.

### Azure Import Jobs

- To bring large amounts of data from on-premises systems into Azure Storage.

**Steps:**

1. **Prepare Disk**: Format and configure the disk for import. (Note: WAImportExport service is supported only by Windows for this step.)
    
2. **Create Job**: Initiate an Azure Import Job via the Azure portal or Azure CLI, specifying details about the data and destination.
    
3. **Ship Drives**: Send the prepared drives to the Azure datacenter.
    
4. **Check Job Status**: Monitor the progress of the import job through the Azure portal or using Azure CLI.
    
5. **Receive Disk**: Once the data is ingested, Azure will send the disk back to you.
    
6. **Check Data in Azure Storage**: Verify that the data has been successfully imported into the Azure Storage account.
    

### Azure Export Jobs

- To move data from Azure Storage to on-premises environments or other locations.

**Steps:**

1. **Create Job**: Initiate an Azure Export Job by specifying the data to be exported and the destination drive.
    
2. **Ship Drive**: Send the specified drive to Azure for data export. (Note: WAImportExport service is used for this step.)
    
3. **Check Job Status**: Track the status of the export job via the Azure portal or Azure CLI.
    
4. **Receive and Unlock Disk**: After the data is exported, you will receive the drive back with the data. Unlock and access the disk for your use.
