# Configuring Blob Object Replication

- **Object Replication:** asynchronously (not immediately) copies block blobs and their versions, between a source storage account, and a destination account.
- Benefits include: 
	- **Minimizing Latency**: Reduce latency for read requests.
	- **Increase Efficiency**: Processing block blobs in different regions.
	- **Data Distribution**: Processing and analyzing data in one location that replicates to other regions.
	- **Cost Optimization**: moving replicated data to the archive tier can reduce costs.

- _Prerequisites_  
	- **Account kind, Access Tier, & Blob Types:** Only GPv2 standard object replication of block blobs and their versions, regardless of default access tiering, on source and destination account.
	- **Cross Subscription & Azure AD:** Object replication is supported across subscriptions and Azure AD tenant.
	- **Versioning:** Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination accounts to perform replication.
	- **Change Feed:** Change feed must be enabled on the source account. Azure storage monitors the `$blobchangefeed` to advice replication.
	- **Replication Policy:** A storage account can be source for up to two destination account. Each policy supports only a single pairing using s policy ID.
