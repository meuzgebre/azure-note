# Storage Network Access

### 1. Public Endpoint

- By default, Azure Storage accounts are accessible via a public endpoint. This is a URL that looks like `https://<accountName>.<subService>.core.windows.net/<resourceName>`
- This URL provides public access to the resources within your storage account, meaning anyone with the URL can access the data unless additional security measures are applied.

### 2. Restricted Access

To enhance security, you can restrict access to your storage account using the following methods:

- **Firewall Rules**: You can configure the storage account's firewall to allow access only from specific IP address ranges or virtual networks. This restricts which networks can communicate with your storage account.
    
- **Virtual Networks**: By setting up network rules, you can specify which virtual networks (VNets) can access the storage account. This is useful for ensuring that only resources within your VNet can access the storage account.
    
- **Resource Instances**: You can also limit access to specific resources (such as VMs) within your network, which can help control and monitor access more granularly.    

### 3. Private Endpoint

A private endpoint enables you to connect to your Azure Storage account using a private IP address from within your virtual network. This means that your storage account is accessed over a private network connection, rather than the public internet, enhancing security and potentially reducing latency. The private endpoint looks something like this `https://<accountName>.privatelink.<subService>.core.windows.net/<resourceName>`

In this setup, the communication between your VNet and the storage account happens entirely within the Azure backbone network, which can offer increased security and performance.

### Summary

- **Public Endpoint**: Default, accessible from the internet.
- **Restricted Access**: Use firewall and network rules to limit access.
- **Private Endpoint**: Access over a private IP within a VNet for enhanced security.
