# Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage is a key component of Azure Storage and provides scalable object storage for a variety of data types. It is accessible via HTTP/REST and is ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data.

### Components of Blobs

- **Blob Service**: A sub-service of Azure Storage, responsible for managing blob storage operations within a storage account.
- **Blob Container**: A container within a storage account that organizes and holds blobs. Containers act as directories for storing blobs.
- **Blobs**: The individual pieces of data stored within containers. Examples include files like images, videos, text, and log files.

### Types of Blobs

1. **Block Blob**:
    - Optimized for storing large amounts of text or binary data. Block blobs are ideal for streaming and storing data that is frequently accessed.
    - Images, videos, and other files where you need to store large objects.

2. **Append Blob**:
    - Designed for scenarios where data needs to be appended to existing data, rather than updated or deleted.
    - Log files where you continually add new log entries.

3. **Page Blob**:
    - Used for storing virtual hard disk (VHD) files. Supports random read and write operations and is optimized for frequent read and write operations.
    - Virtual machine disks (VHDs) used by Azure Virtual Machines.

### Container Access Levels

- **Private**:
    - No anonymous access is granted. Access to the blobs in the container is restricted and can only be granted through authorized means (e.g., shared access signatures or Azure Active Directory).

- **Blob**:
    - Allows anonymous access to the blobs within the container. However, access is limited to the blobs and does not provide access to the container metadata or list of blobs.

- **Container**:
    - Grants anonymous access to both the blobs and the container metadata. Anyone with the URL can access the blobs and see the contents of the container.
