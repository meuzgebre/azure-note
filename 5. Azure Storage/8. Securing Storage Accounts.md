# Securing Storage Accounts

**Data Security**

1. **Data at Rest**
    - **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**: By default, all data stored in Azure Storage services is encrypted using SSE. This ensures that your data is protected from unauthorized access when it is stored in the cloud.

2. **Data in Transit**
    - **Transport-Level Security (HTTPS)**: To secure data being transmitted to and from your Azure Storage account, you can use HTTPS. This ensures that data is encrypted during transmission, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.

**Azure Storage Authentication**

1. **Access Keys**
    - Access keys are generated by Azure and provide unrestricted access to both the management and data layers of an Azure Storage account.
    - Root level access, meaning anyone with these keys has full control over the storage account and its data.
    - Because they offer broad access, keys should be safeguarded carefully. They are typically rotated periodically to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

2. **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**
    - A SAS token is a URL that grants restricted access to resources in your storage account. The SAS is generated from access keys and can be configured to provide access at either the account or service level.
    - Limited access, which can be customized based on the type of SAS token (e.g., service-level, resource-level) and permissions (e.g., read, write).
    - SAS tokens are useful for providing temporary or restricted access to resources without exposing your access keys.

3. **Azure AD Authentication**
    
    - Instead of using access keys, you can use Azure Active Directory (AD) for authentication. Azure AD integrates with Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions and access to resources.
    - Provides granular, role-based access control. Users and applications are authenticated based on their Azure AD identities and assigned roles.
    - This approach can enhance security by reducing the need to manage and expose access keys, and allows for more detailed and manageable access control policies.
