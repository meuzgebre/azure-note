# Introduction


- **What is Cloud Computing?** 
	- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. 
	- Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

- **Shared Responsibility Model** 
	- The shared responsibility model delineates the division of responsibilities between cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers. 
	
	- **Consumer's responsibility**
		- The information and data stored in the cloud
		- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
		- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

	- **The cloud provider's responsibility**
		- The physical datacenter
		- The physical network
		- The physical hosts

#### Cloud Models

- **Public Cloud**
	- Services are delivered over the internet and shared across multiple organizations. 
	- Include Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. 
	- Ideal for scalability and cost-effectiveness. 
	- _Use case_: development and testing environments, and public-facing websites.

- **Private Cloud**
	- Services are maintained on a private network and used exclusively by one organization. 
	- It offers greater control and security but can be more costly.
	- Regulatory requirements, or specialized workloads.

- **Hybrid Cloud**
	- Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. 
	- It provides flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure.
	- For integrating on-premises resources with cloud services.

- **Multi-Cloud:** in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

- **Azure Arc:** Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.

#### Consumption-Based Model

- No upfront costs, pay-as-you-go.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

> **CapEx** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
> 
> **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.


#### Compare Cloud Pricing Models

- **Pay-As-You-Go:** Customers pay for services based on actual usage, without upfront costs or long-term commitments. Suitable for variable workloads.
- **Reserved Instances:** Customers commit to using a service for a longer term (e.g., 1 or 3 years) in exchange for a discount. Useful for predictable workloads.
- **Spot Instances:** Customers bid for unused cloud capacity, often at a lower cost. Ideal for flexible, interruptible workloads.

#### Serverless Computing (Exam)

- Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. 
- The cloud provider automatically handles the infrastructure, scaling, and resource allocation. 
- This model is event-driven and charges only for the actual execution time of code, making it cost-effective and scalable for variable workloads.

# Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **High availability:** each azure services have its own SLA.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales resources up or down based on demand without the need for physical hardware changes.
	- **Vertical:** adding more power to existing resources.
	- **Horizontal:** adding more instances.

#### Reliability Vs Predictability

- **Reliability**
	- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
- **Predictability**
	- Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
	- **Performance**
		- Focuses on predicting the resources needed.
	- **Cost**
		- Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.

# Manageability in the cloud

#### Management of the cloud

- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

#### Management in the cloud

- Through a web portal.
- Using a command line interface.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.
