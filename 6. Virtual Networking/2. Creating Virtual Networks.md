# Creating Virtual Networks
#### Steps for Creation

1. **Determine IP CIDR**
    - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation specifies the IP address range for the VNet.
    - It defines the overall address space for the VNet, determining the number of available IP addresses and ensuring efficient allocation for your network resources.
    - Choose a CIDR block that is large enough to accommodate future growth but does not overlap with other networks.

2. **Subnetting Requirements**
    - Subnetting involves dividing the VNetâ€™s IP address space into smaller, manageable segments called subnets.
    - This helps organize resources, manage network traffic, and apply security policies more effectively.
    - Define subnets based on the specific needs of different applications or departments, ensuring that each subnet has sufficient address space and meets performance requirements.

3. **Connectivity Needs**
    - Connectivity needs include the methods and requirements for connecting the VNet to other networks or the internet.
    - Establishing connectivity ensures that resources within the VNet can communicate with each other, with on-premises systems, or with external services as required.
    - Determine whether you need private connections, public internet access, or interconnectivity with other VNets or on-premises networks.

#### VNet Features

1. **Subnetting**
    - The process of dividing a VNet into smaller, distinct sub-networks.
    - Provides better organization, isolation, and security for different segments of the network.
    - Each subnet can have its own routing policies and network security rules.

2. **Private Network**
    - A network configuration that restricts traffic to internal network resources only, without exposure to the public internet.
    - Enhances security by ensuring that sensitive data and services are not accessible from external sources.

3. **Public Network**
    - Access to the public internet from within the VNet.
    - Allows resources within the VNet to reach out to the internet, which is necessary for certain applications and services.
    - Managed through Network Address Translation (NAT) or public IP addresses.

4. **Peering**    
    - A connection between two VNets that allows resources in each VNet to communicate with each other.
    - Facilitates seamless communication and resource sharing between different VNets while maintaining isolation from other networks.
    - Can be set up within the same region or across different regions.

5. **Network Gateway**
    - A device or service that provides connectivity between the VNet and external networks, including on-premises environments or other VNets.
    - Enables hybrid connectivity scenarios, such as VPN or ExpressRoute, and supports scenarios requiring internet or external network access.

6. **Monitoring**
    - Tools and processes used to track the performance, security, and health of the VNet.
    - Ensures that the network is functioning as expected, helps in troubleshooting issues, and provides insights for optimization.
    - Includes metrics, logs, and alerts related to network traffic, resource usage, and potential security threats.

### Public IP SKU

Public IP SKUs define the features and capabilities of public IP addresses in cloud environments like Azure. They are classified into two main types:

1. **Basic SKU**
    - **Features:**
        - Static IP address
        - Regional availability
        - Single IP address
        - No SLA for availability
    - **Best For:** Small to medium workloads, simple deployments, and scenarios where high availability and advanced features are not critical.

2. **Standard SKU**
    - **Features:**
        - Static IP address
        - Global availability
        - Multiple IP addresses supported
        - SLA for high availability
        - Advanced features like zone redundancy and DDoS protection
    - **Best For:** Mission-critical applications, high-availability scenarios, and deployments requiring enhanced performance, security, and global distribution.
