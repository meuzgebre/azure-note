# Routing Virtual Networks

**Routes**: Paths that determine how traffic flows between different destinations in a network. They are essential for ensuring connectivity within and between virtual networks.

#### Routing Types

1. **System Routes**:
    - Default routes automatically created by Azure when you set up a virtual network.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - Built-in and cannot be modified by users.
        - Handle typical traffic routing scenarios within the virtual network.

2. **Custom Routes**:
    - Routes that you define manually to control traffic flow more granularly.
    - **Types**:
        - **User-Defined Routes (UDRs)**: Custom routes you create to override system routes and direct traffic according to specific needs.
        - **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Routes**: Routes exchanged between networks using BGP, often used for complex routing scenarios or when integrating with on-premises networks.

#### Routing Scenarios

1. **User-Defined Route (UDR)**:
    - **Use Case**: To enforce specific traffic patterns, such as directing traffic through a network virtual appliance or a specific gateway.
    - **Implementation**: Created by adding routes to a route table and associating it with one or more subnets.

2. **BGP**:
    - **Use Case**: When connecting Azure virtual networks to on-premises networks or other cloud providers using BGP for dynamic routing.
    - **Implementation**: Configured in virtual network gateways and allows for automated route propagation and updates.
