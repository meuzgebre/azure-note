# Using Azure Firewall

**Azure Firewall** is a cloud-native platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that provides comprehensive network security for your Azure Virtual Network. It offers a wide range of features to filter and control network traffic, ensuring robust protection and monitoring.

#### Key Features

1. **Filter Traffic with a PaaS Firewall**:
    - Azure Firewall operates as a fully managed service, providing centralized protection without the need to manage infrastructure.

2. **FQDN Support**:
    - **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**: Azure Firewall supports FQDN filtering, allowing you to create rules based on domain names rather than IP addresses. This is useful for managing traffic to web services and applications where IP addresses might change.

#### Core Features

1. **DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation)**:
    - **Purpose**: DNAT allows you to map external IP addresses and ports to internal IP addresses and ports.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for allowing inbound traffic to reach specific resources within your network while maintaining a single public IP address.

2. **SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)**:
    - **Purpose**: SNAT enables the firewall to modify the source IP address of outbound traffic to a specific IP address.
    - **Use Case**: Facilitates outbound traffic from resources within your network to the internet by translating the private IP addresses to a public IP address.

3. **Network Rule Collection**:    
    - **Purpose**: Allows you to create rules that filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
    - **Configuration**: Rules are defined with priority, action (Allow or Deny), and apply to both inbound and outbound traffic.

4. **Application Rule Collection**:
    - **Purpose**: Enables rules based on application-level protocols and FQDNs.
    - **Configuration**: You can specify rules that allow or deny traffic based on the URL or domain name, providing more granular control over web traffic.

5. **Monitoring**:
    - **Logs and Metrics**: Azure Firewall integrates with Azure Monitor, providing detailed logging and metrics on traffic patterns, rule hits, and threats.
    - **Azure Firewall Manager**: Use it for centralized policy management and visibility across multiple firewalls and regions.

#### Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Rules**:
    - Establish both network and application rules to manage traffic based on IP addresses and FQDNs, ensuring comprehensive control.

2. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**:
    - Regularly audit and update your firewall policies to adapt to changing security needs and threat landscapes.

3. **Monitor and Analyze Traffic**:
    - Use logging and monitoring features to keep track of traffic patterns and detect potential issues or threats.

4. **Combine with NSGs**:
    - Use Azure Firewall in conjunction with Network Security Groups (NSGs) for a layered security approach, leveraging both for detailed traffic management and protection.

5. **Consider Scaling**:
    - Azure Firewall offers scalability options to handle increased traffic loads. Ensure that your configuration can scale to meet your organization's needs.
