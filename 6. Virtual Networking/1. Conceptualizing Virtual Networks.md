# Conceptualizing Virtual Networks

1. **Isolated**

- In a virtual network, isolation refers to the separation of different networks or segments to ensure that traffic is confined within specified boundaries.
- This isolation enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and potential interference between different virtual networks or environments.

2. **Private Network Access**

- This concept involves providing secure, internal connectivity that does not traverse the public internet.
- Private network access ensures that sensitive data remains within a controlled environment, reducing exposure to external threats and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

3. **Network Integration**

- Network integration refers to the process of connecting and coordinating different networks to work together seamlessly.
- Effective integration allows for coherent communication and data exchange between various network segments or external networks, facilitating overall functionality and efficiency.

#### Components of Virtual Networks (VNet)

1. **Address Space**

- The address space is a range of IP addresses that are allocated for use within the virtual network.
- It defines the pool of IP addresses available for devices and services within the VNet, ensuring that each device has a unique address within the network.

2. **VNet (Virtual Network)**

- A VNet is a logically isolated network within the cloud environment that provides a private network for resources.
- It allows for the segmentation and isolation of resources, facilitating secure communication within the network and with on-premises systems.

3. **Subnet**

- A subnet is a smaller, more specific segment within a VNet that groups resources together based on their network requirements.
- Subnets help organize and manage network traffic, apply network policies, and control access to different parts of the VNet.
